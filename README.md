# Boxes for iOS

Boxes for iOS is an app that helps users manage their boxes and contents during a move. Boxes is similar in concept to my other project, [Packup for Android](https://www.github.com/ashwinravrao/Packup). Both apps attempt to remove some of the stress surrounding unpacking and looking for items after a move. My expertise is in Android development, so Packup is much more feature rich, leveraging technologies such as NFC and the camera to make searching as easy as packing.
